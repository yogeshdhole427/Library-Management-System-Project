# Library Management System-Project

A Library Management System (LBMS) is a software application designed to manage and automate the various operations of a library efficiently. The system provides a centralized platform for cataloging books, tracking borrowing and returns, managing users (students, faculty, or members), and generating reports. Its main goal is to streamline daily tasks, reduce manual work, and provide quick access to library resources.
